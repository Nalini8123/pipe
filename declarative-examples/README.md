# Declarative Examples

This folder is a home for snippets, tips and tricks and examples for writing Declarative Pipelines with the
[Jenkins Pipeline plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md).

# Layout

The folder is broken up into the following sub-folders:

* [simple-examples](simple-examples) - simple pipelines with one or two stages that illustrate or test a single part of Declarative Pipeline
* [jenkinsfile-examples](jenkinsfile-examples) - for examples of using `Jenkinsfile`s checked into repositories.
